## Preparing demo files.

These file were included in the download.

- SimpleQ_Publisher_Demo.fmp12
- SimpleQ_Subscriber_Demo.fmp12

### Credentials

As part of your setup of the SimpleQ.fmp12 file, you should have changed the passwords for two accounts: "admin" and "server". Similarly, change and confirm that those two accounts have the same passwords in both of these files.

Those two accounts will also need access to the `fmapp` extended privilege. This setting is enabled if you use FileMaker>Sharing>Upload to Host feature.

### Upload to FileMaker server

Upload both demo files to your FileMaker Server. Make sure you can open them.

## Summary

At this point, you should have these three files on your server, and they should be open in FileMaker Pro on your computer.

- SimpleQ.fmp12
- SimpleQ_Publisher_Demo.fmp12
- SimpleQ_Subscriber_Demo.fmp12

They should all have matching account names and passwords for two accounts:

- admin
- server

The privileges set that these accounts are assigned to should have the `fmapp` extended privilege.

## Next

You are now ready to move on to the next step.
